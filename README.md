## 🌍 What Makes This Environment Novel

| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Chain-of-thought workflow** | Agent must extract intent → query tools → then act |
| **Mock CRM + ticket + order tools** | Agent looks up customer history, open tickets, order status before deciding |
| **SLA timers** | Every email has a deadline — reward decays if agent is slow |
| **Policy engine** | Emails tagged with rules: `no_auto_reply`, `must_escalate`, `compliance_review` |
| **Dynamic inbox** | New emails arrive mid-episode — agent must reprioritize |
| **Multi-label routing** | 8 departments: support, billing, legal, engineering, sales, hr, compliance, executive |
| **Adversarial noise** | Spam, phishing, emotional manipulation, incomplete threads, repeated escalations |
| **4 scenario types** | Startup support, HR department, healthcare admin, university admissions |
| **Financial impact signals** | Emails tagged with revenue at risk ($0–$500k) — affects urgency scoring |
| **5-signal reward** | Routing accuracy, SLA speed, reply quality, policy compliance, tool relevance |

## 🎮 Agent Workflow

The agent must follow this chain-of-thought structure:

```
1. select_email      → pick most urgent email from inbox
2. extract_intent    → identify what sender wants + urgency level
3. lookup_customer   → query CRM for customer context (if applicable)
   lookup_ticket     → check existing support tickets
   lookup_order      → verify order/billing details
4. Terminal action:
   → route           → send to correct department
   → reply           → draft response (if allowed by policy)
   → escalate        → flag for senior team
   → request_clarification → ask sender for more info
   → archive         → close low-priority thread
   → delete          → remove spam/phishing
   → flag_policy_violation → mark for compliance review
```

## 🏆 Tasks

### `task_easy` — Startup Support Inbox
- **8 emails**, clear categories, no SLA pressure
- Agent learns: basic routing, tool lookup, reply quality
- Expected baseline: 0.45–0.65

### `task_medium` — HR Department Inbox
- **15 emails**, SLA timers, dynamic arrivals, policy rules
- Includes: harassment complaint, legal dispute, emotional resignation, repeated threads
- Agent learns: urgency detection, policy compliance, reprioritization
- Expected baseline: 0.35–0.55

### `task_hard` — Healthcare Admin + Adversarial
- **25 emails**, strict HIPAA/compliance policies, adversarial noise, high-stakes cases
- Includes: data breaches, $180k churn risk, legal threats, phishing, incomplete threads
- Agent learns: high-stakes decision making, policy over urgency, tool use before action
- Expected baseline: 0.25–0.45

## 📊 Reward Function — 5 Signals

| Signal | Weight | Description |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| Routing accuracy | 40% (easy) / 25% (hard) | Correct department routing |
| Reply quality | 25% | Keyword matching in responses |
| Tool use correctness | 20% | Called right tool for email context |
| Policy compliance | 15% | No auto-replies on blocked emails, proper escalation |
| SLA performance | 10% | Email handled before deadline |
| **Completion bonus** | up to +0.40 | Finishing all emails with accuracy |

Policy violations are **heavily penalized**: −0.20 to −0.30 per violation.

## 🤖 Agent Tips

1. **Always follow the chain-of-thought**: select → extract → tool → act
2. **Check `policy_rules` before replying** — `no_auto_reply` emails must be routed/escalated
3. **`must_escalate` overrides everything** — even if you know the answer
4. **VIP + financial impact = treat as critical** — check CRM first
5. **Spam/phishing → delete immediately** — don't waste steps on it
6. **SLA is ticking** — resolve critical emails first (lowest `sla_remaining`)
7. **Tool calls are rewarded** — always look up context for emails mentioning ticket/order IDs
